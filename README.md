# Multiplayer Math Game
* Hash version *
Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. If a player gets a question wrong, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
